# Structural Elements Comparison

This is a web application developed in R programming language and deployed using shiny package via [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) servers. It compares reinforced concrete, hollowcore concrete and a cross-laminated timber as material options for a slab.
The criteria by which they are compared is: depth, embodied carbon and mass. 

The  application allows for customisation of the loading and spans for each types of slabs. The span/depth values are taken from the Concrete Centre Guide document for the reinforced concrete option and from the FPmccan design guide for the hollowcore option. TRADA timber design document was used to extract span/depth values for cross-laminated timber  slabs.

By default the CO2 values have been taken from the ICE database, but these values can be changed manually, if a different database is used.
